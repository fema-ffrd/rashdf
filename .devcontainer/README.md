# FFRD Devcontainer Template
Devcontainers enable interactive development within a Docker container using VSCode.  

This devcontainer sets up a reproducible environment for Python projects using micromamba environments (a faster and more robust version of Conda).  

When you open this repository in VSCode, you might receive a prompt to re-open the project in a devcontainer. Alternatively, you can access this option through the View menu by selecting Command Palette and then choosing DevContainers: Reopen in Container.  

Additional requirements:
1. An environment file (env.yaml) is required in the .devcontainer folder.  
2. Make sure you have a Docker engine installed locally (such as Docker Desktop).
